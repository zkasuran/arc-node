# Changelog

All notable changes to arc-node are documented in this file.

## [v0.7.3]

**Changes:** [v0.7.2...v0.7.3](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/compare/v0.7.2...v0.7.3) -- [release notes](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/releases/tag/v0.7.3)

### Features

- [CL] Add consensus and RPC Prometheus metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint: `arc_malachite_app_consensus_round_missed` (counter, labeled by the missed round's proposer), `arc_malachite_app_rpc_request_time`, and app-request channel queue-time, process-time, and full-channel-rejection metrics
- [EL] Add the Zero8 hardfork (dormant). Once active on a chain, a rejected delegatecall into a stateful Arc precompile is charged the uniform 200-gas early-revert penalty, matching the penalty already applied to other precompile authorization and validation reverts. Zero8 is not scheduled on any public chain
- [EL] `arc_getCertificate` now accepts a hex-encoded quantity string (e.g. `"0x7"`) for the block-height parameter in addition to a plain decimal number, aligning with the EVM hex-quantity convention used by `eth_getBlockByNumber`

### Fixes

- [EL] Complete the pending-block RPC filter so permissionless callers can no longer read the proposed pre-finalization block through case-variant `pending` tags, previously-uncovered block-content methods, or object-style block parameters
- [Shared] Remediate cargo audit advisories via dependency bumps

### Docs

Full documentation tree at this release: [`arc-node` v0.7.3 docs](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/tree/v0.7.3/docs). New or updated topics in this release:

- Revise the base-fee validation ADR to match the implemented code: rename `elasticity_multiplier` to `inverse_elasticity_multiplier`, drop the unimplemented proportional check, and clarify the `k_rate` description

## [v0.7.2]

**Changes:** [v0.7.1...v0.7.2](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/compare/v0.7.1...v0.7.2) -- [release notes](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/releases/tag/v0.7.2)

*Note: testnet node operators must use v0.7.2 before timestamp `1781791200` (2026-06-18 14:00:00 UTC), when Zero7 activates on testnet. Earlier versions are not supported.*

### For Node Operators

- **[Config] EL JSON-RPC gas cap default lowered to 30M.** `--rpc.gascap` now defaults to `30000000` (previously `50000000`). `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` requests that need more than 30M gas now fail unless the cap is raised. Operators who never set `--rpc.gascap` and do not rely on calls above 30M gas are unaffected; pass `--rpc.gascap <N>` to restore a larger budget. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md#v072) for migration details.
- **[CLI] Replay-unprotected (pre-EIP-155) transactions are rejected over JSON-RPC by default.** The new `--arc.rpc.allow-unprotected-txs` flag defaults to `false`; raw transaction submission returns "only replay-protected (EIP-155) transactions allowed over RPC", matching Geth. Operators that must accept legacy unprotected transactions over RPC pass `--arc.rpc.allow-unprotected-txs`. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md#v072) for migration details.
- **[Config] JSON-RPC batch requests are capped at 100 entries by default.** The new `--arc.rpc.max-batch-entries` flag defaults to `100`; batches with more entries are rejected with JSON-RPC error `-32600` before any per-entry handler runs, and `0` is rejected so the cap cannot be silently disabled. Operators whose tooling sends larger batches raise `--arc.rpc.max-batch-entries <COUNT>`. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md#v072) for migration details.
- **[Config] The invalid-transaction list is enabled by default.** `--invalid-tx-list-enable` now defaults to `true` (previously `false`). On a payload-builder panic, all pending transactions are added to the list and removed from the mempool; resubmit them after investigating. Opt out with `--invalid-tx-list-enable=false`. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md#v072) for migration details.

### Fixes

- [CL] Stop stale proposal streams from blocking live proposals
- [EL] Preserve cold account state when evaluating the SELFDESTRUCT beneficiary check
- [EL] Charge gas before performing storage I/O in precompile helpers
- [EL] Fail closed in the SELFDESTRUCT handler when a blocklist read fails

### Docs

Full documentation tree at this release: [`arc-node` v0.7.2 docs](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/tree/v0.7.2/docs). New or updated topics in this release:

- Add an RPC provider node section to the public node-operation guide

## [v0.7.1]

**Changes:** [v0.7.0...v0.7.1](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1) -- [release notes](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/releases/tag/v0.7.1)

*Note: testnet node operators must use v0.7.1 before timestamp `1779894517` (2026-05-27 15:08:37 UTC), when Zero5/Zero6 activate on testnet. Earlier versions are not supported.*

### For Node Operators

- **[Config] EL RPC connection defaults tightened.** `--rpc.max-connections` default lowered from `500` to `250`; `--rpc.max-subscriptions-per-connection` default lowered from `1024` to `32`. Operators running tooling that opens many concurrent WebSocket connections, or that subscribes more than 32 times on a single connection, must raise these explicitly on the `arc-node-execution` command line. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md#v071) for migration details.

### Features

- [Shared] Enable global keccak cache and asm-backed keccak
- [Spammer] Expose per-run telemetry from the spammer

### Fixes

- [EL] Avoid double-hashing initCode on CREATE2 with non-zero value
- [EL] Activate testnet Zero5/Zero6 by timestamp instead of block height to preserve fork-id compatibility across mixed-version peers

## [v0.7.0]

**Changes:** [v0.6.0...v0.7.0](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0) -- [release notes](https://github.com/circlefin/arc-node/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

### For Node Operators

*Note: mainnet node operators must use v0.7.0. Earlier versions are not supported.* 

- **[Config] Pending transactions are hidden from RPC by default.** Renamed `--arc.hide-pending-txs` (opt-in to hide) to `--arc.expose-pending-txs` (opt-in to expose) and flipped the default. Added `--public-api`, a convenience flag for externally-exposed nodes that forces hiding and warns if `--http.api` / `--ws.api` expose namespaces outside `{eth, net, web3, rpc}`.
- **[Config] CL default log level changed from `debug` to `info`.** Pass `--log-level debug` explicitly if your monitoring depends on debug-level output.
- **[Config] `--follow` no longer requires `--follow.endpoint` for standard chains.** The CL resolves a default RPC endpoint from the chain id at startup; run `arc-node-consensus start --help` for the per-chain defaults. Explicit `--follow.endpoint` still takes precedence.
- **[CLI] New `--txpool.rebroadcast-interval` flag (EL).** Periodic re-announcement of pending transactions to peers (default `60` seconds, `0` to disable). Recovers from missed gossip announcements.
- **[CLI] New `--pprof.heap-prof` flag (EL and CL).** Enables jemalloc heap profiling on demand when built with `--features pprof`. Heap profiling is now inactive by default.
- **[Config] `--execution-persistence-backpressure-threshold` must be greater than zero** and triggers when the gap *reaches* the threshold (previously *exceeds*). Default is `16` and is unchanged; operators who never set this flag explicitly are unaffected. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md#v070) for migration details.
- **[API] New `/ready` readiness probe** and `sync_state` field on the CL `/status` endpoint.
- **[CLI] New `arc-node-consensus db rollback` command** (alias: `unwind`) for operator-driven rollback. Dry-run by default; pass `--execute` to commit. `--num-heights` and `--to-height` are mutually exclusive.
- **[Config] Arc mainnet is a named chainspec** (`--chain arc-mainnet`, chain id `5042`).

### For Validators

- **[CLI] `--validator` flag is required** for a CL to participate in block signing and voting. Without it, the node runs as a non-voting full node. This flag did not exist in `v0.6.0`. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md#v070).
- **[CLI] `--suggested-fee-recipient` is required when `--validator` is set.** It is required that this address be set / non-zero.

  ```
  arc-node-consensus start \
    --validator \
    --suggested-fee-recipient 0xYOUR_ADDRESS \
    ...
  ```

- **[Format] Equivocation evidence log levels raised**: persistence failures promoted from `warn` to `error`, successful persistence from `info` to `warn`. Both include validator addresses for forensics.
- **[API] Validator public key exposed in the CL `/status` endpoint.**
- **[Format] Address and public-key rendering uniformly switched to `0x`-prefixed lowercase hex.** Logs, metrics, and JSON-RPC responses use this single canonical format (signatures continue to use Base64). Tooling that parsed EIP-55 checksummed addresses or non-prefixed hex must be updated.

### Features

- [Shared] Add `--pprof.heap-prof` flag for on-demand heap profiling
- [Shared] Uniformize address and key rendering to `0x`-prefixed lowercase hex
- [Contracts] ProtocolConfig upgrade scripts; remove `rewardBeneficiary` field (proposer-provided fee recipient is authoritative)
- [Contracts] Deploy denylist contract on testnet (mainnet ships it pre-deployed in genesis)
- [Quake] Testnet orchestrator improvements: web topology viewer, node-group support in `load` / `spam`, mesh/health/performance/sanity test runner with report generation, manifest fields for EL/CL CPU and memory limits and `block_gas_limit`
- [Bench] `arc-engine-bench` with IPC and RPC engine transports
- [Bench] Nightly engine bench workflow
- [Spammer] Cache gas estimates for ERC-20 and Guzzler transactions
- [Spammer] Reuse with parallel nonce resync and reduced request timeout
- [Spammer] Improved send-stall visibility
